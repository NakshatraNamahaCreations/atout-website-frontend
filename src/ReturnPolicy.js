            We have a 2-day return/exchange policy, which means you have 2 days after receiving your item to request a return/exchange. Once the return/exchange is approved, it will be delivered in 7-10 business days.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. Youâ€™ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
